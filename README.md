# Listmania
- Work in the `index.html` file provided in this repository.

Create a first level heading for the whole exercise Listmania.

### Part 1 - Ordered Lists

- Create an `h2` element with the content '**Driving Instructions**'
- Underneath, wrap the instructions from the included `lists.txt` file in an **ordered list**
- Wrap each individual instruction in an `li` tag

### Part 2 - Unordered Lists

- In an unordered list, create a **shopping list** with at least five items
- Change the `list-style-type` to **circle**
- Make two of the items links that take the user to an image of the chosen item
- The links should open in a new tab

### Part 3 - Easy Carrot Cake

- The top of the section should have an `h1` tag with the content **Easy Carrot Cake**
- Next should come an `h2` tag with the content **Ingredients**. The ingredients in the `lists.txt` file should come after, wrapped in an unordered list
- Another `h2` should come after that, with the content **Steps**
- Underneath **Steps**, include the steps from the `lists.txt` file in an **ordered list**
- Change the `list-style-type` to whatever you like

### Additional

- Use comments in your markup to specify the lists
- Use **class** or **id** as needed
